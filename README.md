Background

The idea for WhatsApp came to Jan Koum in 2009, while he was working at Yahoo. Jan and his co-founder Brain Acton used their own money to fund the development of the app. It was a simple app that only allowed users to send and receive text messages. In 2013, Facebook acquired WhatsApp for \$19 billion.
